### Squid.js -- Canvas based shape/line framework

Squid.js lets you easily declare a set of shapes that can be drawn upon
a canvas. Either preset shapes, or freehand shapes, or custom tools or
whatever. 

The main point of squid is really to handle picking, moving,
shape editing on the canvas and tracking all the shapes in a way that makes 
it possible to do so in a simple and efficient way.

Feature roadmap:

* Shape editing
* Changes to shape declaration
* State specific drawing of shapes
* Anything really!
