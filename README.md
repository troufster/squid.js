#squid.js 

  HTML5 Canvas based shape/line framework

##What is this stuff?

  Squid.js lets you easily declare a set of shapes that can be drawn upon
  a canvas. Either preset shapes, or freehand shapes, or custom tools or
  whatever.·
   
  The main point of squid is really to handle picking, moving,
  shape editing and so on on the canvas and tracking all the shapes in a
  way that     makes it possible to do so in a simple and efficient way.
     
Feature roadmap:
  
  * Shape editing
  * Changes to shape declaration
  * State specific drawing of shapes
  * Anything!·
                                                                                   
##How do i use it?

  A sample implementation is provided, that's all the documentation for
  now I'm afraid but more might come along if the need arises.

  To run the sample, node.js and express are required
